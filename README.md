The SNHU CS-320 course covered various methodologies for testing a codebase. One of the projects involved developing a series of Java class files, then writing JUnit tests for those class files.

•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
This course did not focus on security. While I did ensure that the class files had appropriate encapsulation, we were not asked to perform any vulnerability checks. I performed vulnerability checks in CS-305. Regarding functionality, the requirements for the scenario were very straightforward and required only beginner knowledge of Java to implement. Writing the tests were also straightforward, albeit a slightly longer process. I tried to account for every conceivable input to the public methods and based on feedback from my professor it appears that my tests were comprehensive.

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The requirements for this scenario were extremely straightforward and left little room to interpretation. The only space for interpretation was regarding object IDs. We were asked to ensure that each object contained a unique ID string, but it was not specified whether the ID was externally supplied. I chose to interpret the requirements the fun way and decided that IDs were generated within the program. This allowed me to play around with a side project by inventing a few different ways to generate unique ID strings.

•	How do I approach designing software?
I feel like this project did not offer much opportunity for designing software. The code was very simple and the requirements were very straightforward. A UML was not supplied, but the requirements had essentially dictated the design.
My approach to implementing this design was to be very minimalistic and to ensure that a method only did one thing. This enabled me to develop a framework which all three object types followed, with only minor tweaks depending on the requirements for that object.

I should note that this "minimalism" does not include my side-project of generating unique strings. That was a bit overbuilt (but I was having fun).
